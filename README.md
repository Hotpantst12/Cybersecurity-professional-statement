# Cybersecurity-professional-statement
During the pandemic, I transitioned from studying odontology to pursuing my passion for technology and cybersecurity. My fascination with computers and operating systems grew into a deep interest in protecting sensitive information and ensuring that people’s trust in organizations is well-placed. Cybersecurity appeals to my curiosity and drive to understand how systems work and how they can be improved.

With over a year of experience in tech support and customer service, I’ve developed strong written and verbal communication skills, excellent teamwork, and patience—essential qualities for navigating complex security challenges and collaborating across teams. My core values of protecting people and adhering to laws, such as GDPR, align perfectly with the mission of safeguarding data and maintaining compliance.

By leveraging my strengths and values, I can support organizations in achieving robust security goals. Whether it’s enhancing defenses against cyber threats, ensuring regulatory compliance, or improving processes, I’m dedicated to delivering innovative solutions. Ultimately, I aim to contribute to companies like Riot Games or CD Projekt Red, where I can help secure the creative and technological environments behind the games that inspire me.
